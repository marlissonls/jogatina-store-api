# API Reference

## Overview

SpringEcommerce exposes a REST API organized into five business modules: IAM, Catalog, Customer, Inventory, and Sales.

Interactive documentation is available through Swagger UI.

- **Swagger UI:** `/swagger-ui/index.html`
- **OpenAPI Specification:** `/v3/api-docs`

## Authentication

The API uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication. Access to protected operations is governed by the application's authorization policies.

## Common API Conventions

### Pagination

Paginated endpoints return results using the application's standard pagination response format, `PageResponse<T>`.

Pagination and sorting parameters are supported where applicable. The available parameters and default values are documented for each endpoint.

### Error Responses

Errors are handled through a centralized exception-handling mechanism and returned using a consistent response format.

HTTP status codes indicate the outcome of a request. Validation errors, resource not found errors, conflicts, authentication failures, and authorization failures are reported using appropriate status codes.

### Authorization

Endpoints may be public or require authentication, depending on their security configuration.

Protected endpoints require a valid Bearer token in the `Authorization` header. Access is restricted according to the roles and permissions configured for each endpoint.

### Request and Response Formats

Endpoints that accept or return structured data use JSON (`application/json`), unless otherwise specified.

Request bodies are validated according to the constraints defined by the application.

### Resource Identification

Resources are identified by their unique IDs, typically represented as UUIDs. Some resources may also be retrieved using alternative identifiers, such as slugs, SKUs, or barcodes, where supported.
